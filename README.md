# Learning-code
General repository for notes pertaining to learning of code at an advanced age
This branch is intended to be a shout_for_help for assistance that I cannot find elsewhere. It also serves as a progress journal in my
quest to learn coding (Python) and robotics (Arduino), the latter specifically to possibly design IoT subsystems and all kinds
of hand stuff. Don't expect much in the line of valuable learning material. Expect a lot in terms of tips on learning from my errors!
